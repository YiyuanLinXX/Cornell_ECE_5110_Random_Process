# Cornell_ECE_5110_Random_Process
This is a repository for **MY PERSONAL** homework for ECE 4110 / ECE 5110 (combined) course given by Dr. Kevin Tang in Fall 2023 at Cornell University. The course is Random Signals in Communication and Signal Processing. It mainly includes Probability, Random Process and Signal Processing. 

I build this repository for easier code submission.
- For the professor and TA, you can check my homework by the index.
- For other students enrolled in ECE4110 / ECE5110, I would be delighted if my solutions and code could serve as a reference and inspiration for you. However, please do not directly copy my work, as it won't benefit your learning. I hope you use my assignment only for verification or to broaden your perspectives. I won't guarantee the accuracy of my work.
- For others, this repository provides a reference of what the course is mainly about. I hope it can help your learning.

If you have any questions or issues, please give an issue on GitHub or feel free to contact me via email [yl3663@cornell.edu](yl3663@cornell.edu)
