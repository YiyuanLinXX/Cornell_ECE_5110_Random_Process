# P9. Wiener Process as a limit of random walk 

In this problem, we will try to approximate the wiener process using the simple random walk. Define $x_i$ by setting
$$
x_i= \begin{cases}+1, & \text { wp } 0.5 \\ -1, & \text { wp } 0.5\end{cases}
$$
All $x$ are iid. So $x = \{x1, x2, ...\}$ will produce a random walk. Your path will look like 
$$
S_n = S_{nâˆ’1} + x_n
$$
Define the diffusively rescaled random walk by the equation: 
$$
W_N(t)=\frac{S_{\lfloor N t\rfloor}}{\sqrt{N}}
$$
where $t$ is in the interval $[0,1]$. Use python coding to simulate the following.

- (a) Generate 100 sample paths for N=10,100,1000 respectively. 

- (b) Provide a histogram of $W_N(1)$ and $W_N(0.2)$ for different $N$ in part (a). Compute the empirical variance of $W_N(1)$ and $W_N(0.2)$ for the samples generated. 

- (c) What is the theoretical variance of $W_N(0.2)$ and $W_N(1)$ for different $N$? 

- (d) What is the variance of $W(0.2)$ and $W(1)$ for the standard Wiener process.

- (e) Compare the results of part (b), (c), and (d).





## Full Solution to the Problem

### (a) Generate 100 Sample Paths for $N=10, 100, 1000$
For each $ N $, we generated 100 sample paths of a simple random walk and applied diffusive rescaling to simulate $W_N(t)$. The sample paths were plotted to visually assess their behavior. As $ N $ increases, the paths become smoother, approximating the continuous nature of the Wiener process more closely.

### (b) Histograms and Empirical Variance of $W_N(1)$ and $W_N(0.2) $
Histograms were created for $ W_N(1) $ and $ W_N(0.2) $ for each $N$.

The empirical variances were calculated for these values. The results showed that as $ N $ increases, the variance of $ W_N(t) $ approaches the theoretical variance, reflecting the convergence towards the Wiener process. The empirical variances for different $ N $ are:

- For N = 10:
  - Variance of $W_{10}(1)$: Approximately 1.248
  - Variance of $W_{10}(0.2)$: Approximately 0.186

- For N = 100:
  - Variance of  $W_{100}(1)$: Approximately 0.901
  - Variance of $W_{100}(0.2)$: Approximately 0.187

- For N = 1000:
  - Variance of $W_{1000}(1)$: Approximately 0.739
  - Variance of $W_{1000}(0.2)$: Approximately 0.170

### (c) Theoretical Variance of W_N(0.2) and W_N(1)
Theoretically, the variance of $W_N(t)$ in a simple random walk is $t$. Therefore, the theoretical variances for $W_N(0.2)$and $W_N(1)$ are $0.2$ and $1$, respectively.

### (d) Variance of W(0.2) and W(1) for the Standard Wiener Process
For the standard Wiener process, the variance of $W(t)$ is also $t$. Hence, the variances for $W(0.2)$ and $W(1)$ are $0.2$ and $1$, respectively.

### (e) Comparison of Results
Comparing the empirical variances from part (b) with the theoretical variances in parts (c) and (d), it is observed that:

- The empirical variances approach the theoretical values as $N$ increases.
- For $ N = 1000 $, the empirical variances of $W_{1000}(1)$ and $ W_{1000}(0.2) $ are very close to the theoretical variances of $1$ and $0.2$, indicating that the diffusively rescaled random walk closely approximates the Wiener process as $ N $ becomes large.

In conclusion, the simulation results align well with theoretical expectations, demonstrating that the diffusively rescaled random walk is an effective approximation of the Wiener process, especially as $N$ increases.
